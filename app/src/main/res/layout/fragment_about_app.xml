I hail from aseverely disadvantaged background and have struggled throughout my childhood and youth to complete aformal education. My vision was inspired by my own journey, froma remote village in Bihar to Delhi. Life was neither easy nor kind to me and I found the need to work as a child laborer in the factories of Kirti Nagar, Delhi to support my family andmy father’s treatment, financially.I worked as a carpenter, an office boy, a data entry operator etc. at various places to earn better wages and to be able to cater to my family’slivingexpenses. Never the less, a midst all these challenging situations, I still managed to continue my studies,fortunately and my strong zeal for education paved the way to achieving an Engineering degree in 2016 from NPTI, one of the most esteemed colleges of Guru Gobind Singh Indraprastha University, New Delhi, where I was awarded a scholarship to pursue my education further. I secured the 9th rank in the University entrance exam. Currently, I am an Engineer in a German MNC and I’m working with the cutting-edge technology of Power Generation, globally. I’ve had the opportunity to travel to Germany and other countries because my job demanded that of me." />
